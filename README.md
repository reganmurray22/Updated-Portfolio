## Portfolio

I am a creative individual with a strong background in logistics, working both as a freelance Production Coordinator, facilitating the management and organization of a broad range of media productions, and in hospitality, planning and executing events ranging from multi-course plated meals for several hundred guests to intimate formal dinners. I am now turning my tenacious energy and considerable skills towards a career in Web Development, and am currently pursuing a certificate in Full Stack Web Development through the University of Minnesota. This is my Portfolio.

## Featuring

### Movie Hub
The Movie Hub App was a collaboration between four fellow classmates and myself. It is first and foremost device agnostic, and a prime example of User Interface Design. 
It was styled using Materialized CSS and features both the OMDB and TheMovieDB APIs.

### Weather Dashboard
Using the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for various cities, I've constructed a Weather App that allows a user to search for a city, and then presents them with 
both the current weather forecast, as well as a five day future forecast for that city. The App utilizes HTML, Bootstrap, CSS and jQuery, and features the OpenWeather API.

### Day Planner
My Daily Planner App allows the user to input and save events for each hour of the day. It runs in the browser, utilizes Local Storage
and dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery, and features the Moment.js library.
